# FETAL_HEALTH_ML
The Fetal Health Prediction Using Machine Learning project aims to predict fetal health based on various medical features, such as fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and maternal health data. By utilizing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, the project classifies fetal health into categories like "Normal," "Suspect," and "Pathological." The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool for early detection of potential fetal health risks, enabling timely intervention. This project uses Python with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, and it demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare applications.
